## Description

The **End-to-End ML Regression Model Builder** is a web-based Streamlit app designed to simplify the process of building and evaluating regression models. It guides users through various steps, from data preprocessing to model selection, evaluation, and downloading of the best model. This application is ideal for users without extensive programming experience who want to quickly build and download regression models for their datasets.

## Features

- User-friendly web interface for easy interaction.
- Upload datasets in CSV or Excel formats.
- Perform exploratory data analysis, handle missing values, outliers, and normalize data.
- Encode categorical variables to prepare data for modeling.
- Train and compare different regression models: Linear Regression, Random Forest, and SVM Regression.
- Automatically identify and present the best model based on the highest R2 score.
- Evaluate model performance with scatter plots and key metrics.
- Visualize feature importance for the best model.
- Download the best-performing model directly from the app.

## Usage
